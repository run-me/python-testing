# Exploring software testing with Python
In my team they call me a good developer, but I know I am not if I don't write "test cases" for the code I contribute. 

So I decided to become one ;)

The resources which the repo is built on top of:
1. STF(not shut the fuck), its software testing fundamentals. [link](http://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/)
2. Getting started with testing in python. [link](https://realpython.com/python-testing/)
